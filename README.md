## Description
This project was created as both experience using react and to update my personal portfolio.

## Requirements
- When the user loads the portfolio, then they are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
- When the user views the header, then they are presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
- When the user views the navigation links, then they are presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
- When the user clicks the navigation title, then they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
